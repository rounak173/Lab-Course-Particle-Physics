\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusion}
The search  for the decay $B_{s}^{0} \rightarrow \psi(2S)K_{s}^{0}$ yields a number of signal and background candidates of 30 and 17, respectively. Signal is observed with a significance of 4.42. It indicates that signal has been found from the real dataset. The classifier training could have been improved with more hyperparameter optimizations. But, considering the limited scope of the analysis, it was kept limited. This might lead to limitations. The model used for the analysis is XGBClassifier, the opportunity to use other classification model is also open.\\

Both the simulations were produced using Monte-Carlo simulation technique. Even if specific weights are put in place to minimize the differences between data and simulations, these later ones can never be identical to real data in the behavior of all of their variables. All of these factors have affected the results of the analysis.\\
