\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The analysis of the decay channels $B^{+}\to K^+K^+K^âˆ’$ and $B^- \to K^- K^- K^+$ through both simulation and LHCb experimental data has confirmed the presence of CP violation, both globally and locally. The simulation results closely matched those obtained from the LHCb detector, validating the analysis procedure. The global CP asymmetry was measured to be A = 0.0370 with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.0065$ and significance of $5.73\,\sigma$, satisfying the discovery threshold in particle physics. Additionally, local CP asymmetry identified through Dalitz plot analysis yielded A = 0.1238 with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.0209$ and significance of $6.77\,\sigma$, further strengthening the evidence for CP violation. These results not only support the predictions of the Standard Model but also point toward unexplained asymmetries that may hint at new physics.
