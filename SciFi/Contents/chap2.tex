    The laboratory experiment involved a computer-controlled system, a spectrometer and an xy-table. The spectrometer is used for detecting the light produced and reflected within the fibers. The spectrometer saturates at about 65,000 counts.\\
    
    The fiber is excited using a movable LED box along the x-axis only. The LED current was set up to be $20 \,mA$ Additionally, a specialized device can rotate the spectrometer horizontally and vertically, but due to physical constraints, it can only scan within angular ranges of $[-20^\circ, 90^\circ]$ horizontally and $[-6^\circ, 90^\circ]$ vertically. The integration time was considered to be $10000 \,\mu s$ and reading were averaged $5$ times.\\
