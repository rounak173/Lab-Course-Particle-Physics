\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The investigation of scintillating fibers for the LHCb SciFi Tracker revealed key insights into their light transmission behavior and structural efficiency. Through both experimental and simulation analyses, the spatial resolution and angular photon distribution were characterized. Simulation data showed strong alignment with theoretical expectations, including attenuation behavior and total internal reflection characteristics for both core and cladding photons. Moreover, the experimental intensity measurements showed consistency with the simulation data. In summary, the simulation results provided a robust understanding, confirming that the optical behavior of the fibers satisfies the design expectations under ideal conditions.\\

 % Additionally, human error in data handling or interpretation could also contribute.



Therefore, our study strongly supports particle detection using scintillating fibers in high-precision detector systems such as LHCb.
